# Agency and Intentions in Language (AIL)

__[[TOC]]__

This repository is a template website for AIL workshops.
The README.md file contains some general instructions how to create a website using GitHub pages.
It is assumed that you are using GitHub on a browser, but you can also clone the repo and modify files locally.
If you need any assistance, feel free to contact Julie Goncharov at julie.goncharov@gmail.com

**Acknowledgement:** most html and css files are adapted from the SALT website created by Dylan Bumford and Sarah Murray.

## Create a new repository for your workshop

1. in the top right corner, click on the "+" sign and choose `New repository"
1. from the drop down menu, choose a repository template as `ail-workhop/AILn-Workshop-template` 
1. name your repo, e.g., `AILn-Workshop`

## Modify .html

At the first stage, you only need to modify `index.html` which is the entry point.
