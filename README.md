# Agency and Intentions in Language (AIL)

This repository is a template website for AIL workshops.
The README.md file contains general instructions how to create a website using GitHub pages.
It is assumed that you are using the browser, but you can also clone the repo and modify files locally.
If you need any assistance, feel free to contact Julie Goncharov at julie.goncharov@gmail.com


1. Create a new repository for your workshop

* in the top right corner, click on the "+" sign and choose `New repository"
* from the drop down menu, choose a repository template as `ail-workhop/AILn-Workshop-template` 
* name your repo, e.g., `AILn-Workshop`
* click on "Create repository"

1. Modify index.html

At the first stage, you only need to modify `index.html` which is the entry point.
Other pages (Call, Program, and Registration/Zoom are setup as "to be added soon" in call_tba.html, program_tba.html, and registration_tba.html)
