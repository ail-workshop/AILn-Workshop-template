# Agency and Intentions in Language (AIL)

This repository is a template website for AIL workshops.
The README.md file contains some general instructions how to create a website using GitHub pages.
It is assumed that you are using GitHub on a browser, but you can also clone the repo and modify files locally.
If you need any assistance, feel free to contact Julie Goncharov at julie.goncharov@gmail.com

**Acknowledgement:** most html and css files are adapted from the SALT website created by Dylan Bumford and Sarah Murray.

## Step 1: create a new repository for your workshop

The first step is to create a new repository using an exiting repository template.

1. In the top right corner, click on the "+" sign and choose `New repository".
1. From the drop down menu, choose a repository template as `ail-workhop/AILn-Workshop-template`.
1. Name your repo, e.g., `AIL1-Workshop`.
1. Click on "Create repository".


## Step 2: modify the head section of html files

The website consists of four html pages:

* `index.html` is the entry point with general information about the workshop
* `call.html` is used to publish Call for Papers
* `program.html` is used to publish the program
* `registration.html` is used for announcements about registration and Zoom links

At this step, modify the head section of each html tile with information about the workshop.

1. Go to your new repo.
1. Go to `Code` and click on `index.html`.
1. Click on the pencil button (middle page to the right) to start editing.
1. Modify lines 6, 8, 10, 20, 24, 29, 32 (use "modify ..." comments as reference).
1. Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section.
1. Write a simple commit message.
1. Click on the green button "Commit changes".
1. Repeat the same for `call.html`, 'program.html`, and `registration.html`.


## Step 3: modify text/links in `index.html` and `call.html`

At the Call for Papers stage, you only need to modify the text and links in `index.html` and `call.html`.
The Program and Registration pages are set up with TBA messages and will be modified at **Step 5**.


## Step 4: publish cite

## Step 5: add your AIL to Home

## Step 6: update Program and Registration
